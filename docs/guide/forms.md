# Form elements

Buttons are among the most common UI elements, so great care has been put into making them easy to use and
very extensible for all kinds of purposes.

## Text inputs

All input elements are styled by default, so you don't have to apply any classes

<div>
  <label for="text_input">Input label</label>
  <input placeholder="Text input..." id="text_input">
</div>

```html
<label for="text_input">Input label</label>
<input placeholder="Text input..." id="text_input">
```
